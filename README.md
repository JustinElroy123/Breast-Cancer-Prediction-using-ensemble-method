Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting breast cancer diagnosis using various ensemble methods. The primary goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on medical features.

Features
Data Collection: Utilizes a dataset containing features extracted from breast cancer biopsy results.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Selection: Identifies the most important features contributing to the diagnosis using techniques like feature importance from RandomForest.

Model Training: Implements several ensemble methods, including SVM ,RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

Prediction: Uses the trained models to make predictions on new data, providing diagnosis and probability scores.

Visualization: Generates visualizations like confusion matrices and correlation heatmaps for better understanding and interpretation.
